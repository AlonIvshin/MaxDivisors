# MaxDivisors
This mini software was created as a part of my preparation for an interview.
The software finds the number with the maximum divisors in the given range from 1 to x.
The output is the number, the amount of its divisors, and how much time was taken to solve it.
I used here multi-threading the user can choose how many threads will run in the process.
